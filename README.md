# Golateh : A Failed Venture, A Valuable Lesson

This repository contains the source code for **Golateh**, an early attempt to develop a **wage calculation system** tailored for the seafood industry, specifically for fish catchers. The project aimed to replace traditional, time-consuming methods of wage calculation with a modern software solution, addressing inefficiencies and reducing disputes between employees and employers.

Although the project was not completed as a commercially viable product, it represents a significant learning experience, both technically and personally.

## **Overview**

The primary goal of **Golateh** was to streamline the wage calculation process for the seafood industry. It was designed with features such as:

- Automated wage calculations based on catch metrics.
- Visualization of catch data using charts and graphs.
- Tools for resolving disputes with transparent calculations.

However, the project faced several challenges, which ultimately led to its failure. Despite this, it taught me invaluable lessons about software development and user-centric design.

## **Why Golateh Failed**

The project faced several critical challenges that led to its discontinuation:

1. **Overly Complex Design**  
   Drawing inspiration from ERP systems, the application included advanced features that were unnecessary for its intended audience. This led to a system too complicated for users with limited technical knowledge.

2. **Poor UI/UX Design**  
   The interface was saturated with charts and data visualizations, overwhelming users rather than simplifying their experience.

3. **Technical Shortcomings**  
   - Lack of scalability and proper architecture made the codebase unmanageable.  
   - Neglecting best practices and paradigms resulted in obsolete code that couldn't be easily refactored or debugged.

4. **Limited Resources**  
   As my first individual project, I underestimated the challenges of commercializing software. Rebuilding the system to address its shortcomings required time and funding that were beyond my resources at the time.

## **Lessons Learned**

Despite the project's failure, it provided several valuable insights:  

- The importance of understanding your **end users** and designing solutions tailored to their capabilities.  
- Avoiding feature creep by focusing on a **minimum viable product (MVP)** for initial releases.  
- The necessity of following **scalable architecture** and clean coding principles, even in smaller projects.  
- Recognizing the need for user testing and feedback loops early in the development process.

## **Future Plans**

While this project was abandoned, I plan to revisit **Golateh** in the future with a more user-friendly and scalable design. Lessons from this attempt will guide the development of a solution that genuinely benefits the fishing community.
